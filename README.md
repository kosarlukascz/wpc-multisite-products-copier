# WPC Multisite Products Copier

A WordPress plugin for copying WooCommerce variable products between sites in a multisite network.

> ðŸ¤– **Development Note**: This plugin was developed through vibe coding sessions with Claude (Anthropic's AI assistant), demonstrating the power of AI-assisted development for creating complex WordPress solutions.

## Overview

WPC Multisite Products Copier allows you to copy or update WooCommerce variable products from a source site (Blog ID 5) to any other site in your multisite network. It handles product variations, images, attributes, and integrations with popular plugins like ACF and Woodmart.

## Features

- âœ… Copy complete variable products with all variations
- âœ… Update existing products (slug, images, gallery)
- âœ… Automatic image copying and management
- âœ… Preserve product attributes and terms
- âœ… ACF (Advanced Custom Fields) support
- âœ… Woodmart theme video gallery support
- âœ… AJAX-powered admin interface
- âœ… Comprehensive logging system
- âœ… Automatic cleanup of unused images

## Requirements

- WordPress 5.0 or higher
- WordPress Multisite enabled
- WooCommerce 3.0 or higher
- PHP 7.4 or higher
- Source products must be on Blog ID 5

## Installation

1. Upload the `wpc-multisite-products-copier` folder to `/wp-content/plugins/`
2. Network activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress Network Admin
3. The plugin will only be active on Blog ID 5 (source site)

## Usage

### Copying a Product

1. Navigate to a variable product on Blog ID 5
2. Look for the "Multisite Product Sync" metabox in the sidebar
3. Select the target site from the dropdown
4. Click "Create on selected site"
5. The product will be copied with all variations and images

### Updating a Product

1. If a product has already been copied, the target site will show in the "Synced to" list
2. Select the target site from the dropdown
3. Click "Update on selected site"
4. Only the slug, featured image, and gallery images will be updated

## Configuration

### Debug Logging

Debug logging is controlled by the `$debug_enabled` property in the main class:

```php
private $debug_enabled = false; // Set to true to enable logging
```

Logs are stored in: `wp-content/uploads/wpc-mpc-logs/`

### Source Blog ID

The source blog ID is set to 5 by default. To change it, modify:

```php
private $source_blog_id = 5;
```

## Integrations

### ACF (Advanced Custom Fields)

The plugin automatically handles ACF image fields:
- `feed_image` - Product feed image
- `swatch_image` - Product swatch image

ACF fields are copied along with the product and images are properly mapped to the target site.

### Woodmart Theme

Supports Woodmart's video gallery feature:
- Copies video gallery settings from source product
- Maps to the second gallery image on target site
- Preserves all video settings (autoplay, controls, etc.)
- Maintains original video URLs from source site

## How It Works

### Product Creation Flow

1. **Validation** - Checks if source product is variable
2. **Data Collection** - Gathers product data, meta, and custom fields
3. **Blog Switch** - Switches to target blog
4. **Product Creation** - Creates base product
5. **Attribute Mapping** - Maps attributes and creates missing terms
6. **Image Copying** - Copies featured and gallery images
7. **Variation Creation** - Creates all product variations
8. **Integration Handling** - Processes ACF and Woodmart data
9. **Cleanup** - Syncs attributes and updates lookup tables

### Product Update Flow

1. **Data Collection** - Gets updated slug and images from source
2. **Blog Switch** - Switches to target blog
3. **Slug Update** - Updates product slug
4. **Image Update** - Replaces featured and gallery images
5. **Integration Update** - Updates Woodmart video gallery
6. **Cleanup** - Removes unused old images

## Troubleshooting

### Images Not Updating

1. Clear any caching plugins
2. Check PHP OPcache settings
3. Verify file permissions on upload directories
4. Check debug logs for errors

### Products Not Syncing

1. Ensure source product is a variable product
2. Verify multisite network is properly configured
3. Check user capabilities (must have `edit_products`)

2. Ensure adequate PHP memory limit
3. Consider copying products in batches
4. Clean up old log files regularly

### Key Methods

- `create_product_on_blog()` - Main product creation logic
- `update_product_on_blog()` - Product update logic
- `copy_image_to_blog()` - Image copying logic
- `handle_woodmart_video_gallery()` - Woodmart integration

### Adding New Integrations

To add support for a new plugin/theme:

1. Create a handler method following the pattern of `handle_woodmart_video_gallery()`
2. Call it from both `create_product_on_blog()` and `update_product_on_blog()` methods
3. Use blog switching utilities to manage context
